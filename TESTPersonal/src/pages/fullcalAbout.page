<h1>Chatter Calendar - developer sample</h1>

<p>The Chatter calendar allows you to view the calendar for each member of a 
Chatter Group.  The application is 
intended to serve as a developer sample and contains several areas for improvement.  
Testing has been limited to my own efforts and 
cannot be characterized as complete for production purposes.</p>

<p>The Calendar Day tab is experimental</p>

<h2>Post Install instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Edit the Event field <b>Type</b> Picklist Values 
<a href="https://na7.salesforce.com/p/setup/field/StandardFieldAttributes/d?id=Type&type=Event">found here</a>
	to add a type called "Available".  This type will indicate a workshift 
	event (when a user is available to be scheduled)	on the Calendar Day view.</li>
<li>Edit the Event layout to add the Type picklist to the event layout 
<a href="/ui/setup/layout/PageLayouts?type=Event">Event Layouts</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a Chatter group with 3-7 members, more than that and the calendar 
	may become slow</li>
<li>Enter that group name in the input box on 
	the <a href="/apex/fullcalGroup">Calendar Group</a> 
	tab and select that group to view</li>

<li>You should now see the users calendars for day, week and month</li>
<li>For each user, click the small gear icon (<span alt="Color" class="ui-icon ui-icon-gear">&nbsp;</span>) 
	and select a color for that user's events, save the color and the page should refresh to show this color.</li>
<li>Create a new event by clicking on the page, fill in a subject and click to save.</li>
</ul>
